Now, Carla is having a hard time telling the difference between fact and fantasy, unable to find logical explanations. For instance, how on earth has the unseen assailant managed to break into her secured, locked-up home? Nevertheless, the painful bruises in hard-to-reach parts of Carla's body don't lie. And--as all attempts with psychotherapy failed, and the late-night paranormal attacks become increasingly violent--desperate Carla has no other choice but to turn to a team of parapsychologists who offer, at least, hope for a resolution. However, is there an escape from abstract evil? Above all, can Carla beat the Entity?",

An eccentric millionaire Norman Osborn administers a performance enhancing drug on himself and his maniacal alter ego Green Goblin emerges. Now Peter Parker has to become Spider-Man and take Green Goblin to the task... or else Goblin will kill him.

All hope seems lost when suddenly Peter's suit turns jet-black and greatly amplifies his powers. But it also begins to greatly amplify the much darker qualities of Peter's personality that he begins to lose himself to. Peter has to reach deep inside himself to free the compassionate hero he used to be if he is to ever conquer the darkness within and face not only his greatest enemies, but also...himself.",

In order to survive he comes up with a way to miniaturize the battery and figures out that the battery can power something else. Thus Iron Man is born. He uses the primitive device to escape from the cave in Iraq. Once back home, he then begins work on perfecting the Iron Man suit. But the man who was put in charge of Stark Industries has plans of his own to take over Tony's technology for other matters.",
